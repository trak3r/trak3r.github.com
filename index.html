          Grizzled seasoned veterans of the first dot-com bubble. No newbies here. Having started at the bottom as system administrators and code monkeys, we've worked our way up over the years earning the prestigious titles of Chief This and Vice President of That. But we yearn for the good old days of small tight-knit teams, fresh ideas, and vivacious start-ups.
